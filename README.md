Binary-to-decimal converter made with Vue.JS. Currently on v1.1

## Information

The app's been made with Vue.JS as a part of my learning path. It's been really useful to practice some JS syntax, CSS flexbox, git-flow and deployment.

# Latest Features

Version 1.1 comes with:

    - Binary (positive and negative) convertions to decimal (Simple Binary, Ca1 and Ca2)
    - Decimal (only positive) convertions to binary (Simple Binary, Ca1 and Ca2) with the chance of limiting the bits.

What's coming up in the future:

    - Work with floating point numbers and implicit bits
    - IEEE754 convertions
    - Octal and Hex convertions

## Preview
