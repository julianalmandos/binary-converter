[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3b8fc04c-3e7f-48ef-bac0-4131ff9b9cc8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/binary-to-decimal/deploys)

Binary-to-decimal converter made with Vue.JS. Currently on v2

## Information

The app's been made with Vue.JS as a part of my learning path. It's been really useful to practice some JS syntax, CSS flexbox, git-flow and deployment.

# Latest Features

Version 1.2 comes with:

    âœ… Negative decimal convertions to binary (Simple Binary, Ca1 and Ca2) with the chance of limiting the bits.
    âœ… Mobile version (doesn't include Records && Language selection)!
    âœ… Languages! Choose between English or Spanish dynamically.
    âœ… Records! Keep track of your last convertions with the new Records section.

# Old Features

Version 1.1 comes with:

    âœ… Binary (positive and negative) convertions to decimal (Simple Binary, Ca1 and Ca2)
    âœ… Decimal (only positive) convertions to binary (Simple Binary, Ca1 and Ca2) with the chance of limiting the bits.

# The future

These are some features that will come up in the future (if I have the time to build them):

    ðŸŸ  Work with floating point numbers and implicit bits
    ðŸŸ  IEEE754 convertions
    ðŸŸ  Octal and Hex convertions
